The Falcon 9 is an in-service, high-capacity American launch vehicle
developed by SpaceX to transport cargo and humans to the International
Space Station (ISS). The rocket is intended for humans, has two stages
and is powered by liquid fuel. Flying from 2010 to the present, it has
been used for numerous ISS resupply missions and to launch numerous
satellites. As of 2023, Falcon 9 is one of the main launch vehicles
carrying people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the
record for the highest success rate in reusable rocket launches: it
has been successfully reused more than 50 times. The largest
production model in the Falcon family of rockets, Falcon 9 was
designed under the leadership of Elon Musk at SpaceX in Hawthorne,
California; the prime contractor is SpaceX. Many flight-capable
vehicles have been built, with multiple improved versions over time.
Most have been launched from various locations, including Kennedy
Space Center, without major loss of crew or payload. Falcon 9 has
played a key role in SpaceX's program to carry astronauts to the ISS,
starting with the Demo-2 mission in May 2020.
