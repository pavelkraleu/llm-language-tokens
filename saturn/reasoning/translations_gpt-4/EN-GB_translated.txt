Falcon 9 is an operational American two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift
launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for the reliable and safe
transportation of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit. The
rocket is human-rated, has two stages, and is powered with liquid
fuel. Flown from 2010 to present, it has been used for various
missions including carrying cargo to the International Space Station,
launching satellites, and even sending spacecraft to the Moon, Mars,
and beyond.  As of 2023, the Falcon 9 has been used for numerous
flights beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds records for the
most flights of an orbital-class rocket: The vehicle is capable of
carrying up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to low Earth orbit, and up
to 8,300 kilograms (18,300 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).
The Falcon 9, as part of the Falcon family of rockets, was designed
under the direction of Elon Musk at the SpaceX headquarters in
Hawthorne, California; the lead contractor is SpaceX. Dozens of
flight-capable vehicles have been built, with a robust program for
ground testing. Most were launched from either Kennedy Space Center or
Cape Canaveral Space Force Station with no loss of crew or payload.
Falcon 9 has also been instrumental in launching astronauts to the
International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
