Falcon 9 is an operational American two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit. The rocket is human-rated, has two stages, and is powered with liquid fuel. First flown in 2010, it has been used for numerous cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, as well as launching various satellites and interplanetary missions.
As of 2023, the Falcon 9 has been used to carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Falcon 9 holds records for the most flights of any orbital rocket: over 125, many of which have been to low Earth orbit (LEO).
The Falcon 9 is the first rocket in the Falcon family of rockets, and was designed under the direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX is the sole contractor. A large number of flight-capable vehicles have been built, with the rocket being designed for reusability to reduce the cost of access to space. Most launches have been from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 and Kennedy Space Center with no loss of crew or payload. Falcon 9 has enabled numerous astronauts and cargo payloads to reach the ISS since its first crewed flight in May 2020.
