"Falcon 9 is an American launch vehicle developed by the private space
company SpaceX, mainly to transport satellites and cargo to the
International Space Station. The rocket has been modified for human
use, has two engines and is powered by liquid fuel. It has been in
service since 2010 and is used on a regular basis, including manned
trips to the International Space Station. As of 2023, Falcon 9 is one
of the few rockets that can take humans beyond low Earth orbit. Falcon
9 holds the record for the highest reusability: the rocket can be used
up to 10 times without repair or modification. "Falcon 9 was developed
by a team of SpaceX engineers under the leadership of Elon Musk, the
company's founder and chief engineer, with SpaceX as prime contractor.
In total, more than 100 Falcon 9 rockets have been built and launched
from various spaceports, including Kennedy Space Centre, without
serious loss of crew or payload.
