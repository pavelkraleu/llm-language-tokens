The Falcon 9 is an operational US two-stage launcher developed by
SpaceX to enable cost-effective access to space. The rocket is
approved for humans, has two stages and was powered by liquid fuel. It
has been flying since 2010 and has been used for several manned
flights to the International Space Station (ISS) and to launch various
satellites. As of 2023, the Falcon 9 is one of the launchers that has
carried humans to low Earth orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 holds the record
for the first launcher to successfully land back on Earth after a
mission in orbit: the Falcon 9 has a payload capacity to low Earth
orbit: 22,800 kg to LEO, and 8,300 kg to geostationary transfer orbit
(GTO). Falcon 9 is the first production model in the Falcon family and
was constructed under the direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX's
facilities in Hawthorne, California. In total, over 80 Falcon 9
rockets have been launched, with a high degree of success. It has also
been used to send astronauts to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial
Crew Programme.
