Falcon 9 is an American two-stage rocket developed by SpaceX to
transport people and payloads to Earth orbit and Mars. The rocket is
human-rated, has two stages and is fuelled by liquid fuel. It has been
in operation since 2010 and has been used for several manned flights
to the International Space Station (ISS) and to launch various
satellites into orbit.  By 2023, the Falcon 9 is among the most
reliable and utilised rockets that have carried people and payloads to
Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the record for the first reuse
and landing of an orbital rocket: the first stage can return to a
landing site and land vertically instead of being discarded in the
ocean after launch.  The Falcon 9 is the main rocket in SpaceX's fleet
and was designed under the direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX
headquarters in Hawthorne, California; the prime contractor is SpaceX
itself. Many versions of the Falcon 9 have been built and launched,
all from SpaceX's various launch sites. Several astronauts have been
sent to the ISS aboard the Falcon 9 as part of NASA's Commercial Crew
Programme.
