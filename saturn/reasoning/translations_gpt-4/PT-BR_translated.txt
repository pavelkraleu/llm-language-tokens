The Falcon 9 is a reusable and operational American launch vehicle
developed by SpaceX for space exploration. The rocket is classified as
human-rated, has two stages and is fuelled with liquid fuel. It flew
for the first time in 2010 and has been used on several manned flights
to the International Space Station and to launch various satellites.
As of 2023, the Falcon 9 has been a crucial part of transporting
humans and payloads to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 can carry
up to 22,800 kg (50,265 lb) into low Earth orbit. Part of the Falcon
family of rockets, the Falcon 9 was designed by SpaceX, the space
exploration company founded by Elon Musk. Production of the Falcon 9
takes place mainly at the SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California. So
far, dozens of Falcon 9 vehicles have been built and launched, many of
which have been reused thanks to the vertical landing design of the
rocket's first stage. SpaceX has achieved remarkable success with the
Falcon 9, including the first successful landing of an orbital first
stage and the first reuse of a first stage.
