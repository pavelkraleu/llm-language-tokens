Falcon 9 is an operational American two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transportation of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit. The rocket is human-rated, has two stages, and is powered with liquid fuel. Flown from 2010 to present, it has been used for various missions including carrying cargo to the International Space Station, launching satellites, and even sending spacecraft to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

As of 2023, the Falcon 9 has been used for numerous flights beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds records for the most flights of an orbital-class rocket: The vehicle is capable of carrying up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to low Earth orbit, and up to 8,300 kilograms (18,300 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

The Falcon 9, as part of the Falcon family of rockets, was designed under the direction of Elon Musk at the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California; the lead contractor is SpaceX. Dozens of flight-capable vehicles have been built, with a robust program for ground testing. Most were launched from either Kennedy Space Center or Cape Canaveral Space Force Station with no loss of crew or payload. Falcon 9 has also been instrumental in launching astronauts to the International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
