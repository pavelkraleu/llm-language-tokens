Falcon 9 is an American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX to carry
cargo to orbit and to the International Space Station (ISS). The
rocket is designed for humans, has two stages and is powered by liquid
fuel. It was first launched in 2010 and has since been used for many
flights, including transporting cargo for NASA.  Falcon 9 is the first
orbital class of rocket capable of landing, allowing it to be reused.
Falcon 9 holds the records for heaviest launched payload and largest
payload to low Earth orbit: 22,800 kg (50,265 lb) for low Earth orbit
(LEO) and 8,300 kg (18,300 lb) for geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).
Falcon 9, part of the Falcon family of rockets, was designed under the
direction of Elon Musk; SpaceX is the primary manufacturer. In total,
many Falcon 9 rockets have been built and all have been launched from
various spaceports, including Kennedy Space Center, without loss of
crew or payload. In 2020, the first 4 astronauts aboard a Falcon 9
headed to the International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial
Crew program.
