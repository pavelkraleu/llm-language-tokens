Falcon 9 is an American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for human
space exploration. The rocket is manned, has two stages and is fuelled
by liquid fuel. It has been in service since 2010 and has been used
for several manned missions to the International Space Station and to
launch various satellites. In 2023, Falcon 9 is one of the launchers
that has carried humans to low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 has a
payload capacity to low Earth orbit of 22,800kg, which includes the
second stage and the unburned fuel necessary to send the payload to
its destination. Falcon 9 is part of the Falcon rocket series and was
constructed under the direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX headquarters in
Hawthorne, California. The main contractor is SpaceX itself. In total,
many Falcon 9 rockets have been built, and many of them have been
launched from Kennedy Space Centre and other locations without loss of
crew or payload. Several astronauts have been sent up to the
International Space Station on Falcon 9s since the first manned flight
in May 2020.
