The Falcon 9 is an American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX to
transport satellites and the Dragon spacecraft to the International
Space Station. The rocket is suitable for humans, has two stages and
is fuelled by liquid propellant. It has been used for numerous flights
to the International Space Station and for launching various
satellites since 2010.  Until 2023, the Falcon 9 will remain one of
the few launch vehicles to have carried humans to the International
Space Station. The Falcon 9 holds the record for the most launches in
one year: 26 flights in 2020.  The Falcon 9, the most important
production model in the SpaceX rocket family, was developed under the
direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California; the main
contractor is SpaceX itself. In total, over a hundred Falcon 9 rockets
have been built and launched by 2021, many of them multiple times
thanks to their reusability. All were launched from the Kennedy Space
Centre or Cape Canaveral Space Force Station without losing crew or
payload. To date, a total of four manned missions to the International
Space Station have been carried out with the Falcon 9.
