Falcon 9 is an operational US launcher developed by SpaceX to
transport satellites and the Dragon spacecraft to space. The rocket is
human-capable, has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel. The
rocket flew from 2010 and continues to be used for both unmanned and
manned flights to the International Space Station (ISS).  As of 2023,
the Falcon 9 is a major launch vehicle that has taken humans to low-
Earth orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 is known for its reusability and
ability to send heavy payloads to low Earth orbit: up to 50,265 lb
(22,800 kg) for a reusable configuration.  The Falcon 9, the workhorse
of the SpaceX rocket family, was designed under the leadership of Elon
Musk at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX is the prime
contractor. Dozens of vehicles have been built and launched so far,
with a high success rate. Falcon 9 rockets are launched from both
Kennedy Space Center and Vandenberg Air Force Base, with no loss of
crew and a very high success rate in launching payloads. A total of
several astronauts have been sent to the ISS on Falcon 9 and the
Dragon spacecraft since the first manned mission in May 2020.
