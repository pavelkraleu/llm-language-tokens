The Falcon 9 is an operational US two-stage launch vehicle developed
by SpaceX for the International Space Station (ISS) and commercial
space travel. The rocket was a manned rocket, two-stage, and powered
by liquid propellant. It has flown since 2010 and has been used for
hundreds of space missions, including trips to the International Space
Station and commercial satellite launches.  The Falcon 9 is the most
commonly used launch vehicle to carry humans into low Earth orbit
(LEO). The Falcon 9 holds the record for the most successful vertical
landings, which allows the first stage of the rocket to be recycled:
this greatly reduces the cost of missions.  The Falcon 9, SpaceX's
most popular rocket, was designed under the direction of Elon Musk at
SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX is the prime
contractor and manufacturer. They have conducted hundreds of
successful launches, including trips to the ISS and commercial
satellite launches. The Falcon 9 has also performed several manned
missions, including the launch of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, which
carried US astronauts to the ISS.
