Falcon 9 is an active American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for
commercial and government flights. The rocket is designed for humans,
has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel. It has been in service
since 2010 and has been used for a number of missions, including the
Dragon Cargo and Crew launches, as well as the Starlink satellites.
As of 2020, Falcon 9 remains one of the launch vehicles that have
carried humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the record
for the most reused stages: first stages have been successfully reused
up to 10 times.  Falcon 9, the most widely used model in the SpaceX
family of rockets, was designed under Elon Musk's direction in
Hawthorne, California; the prime contractor is SpaceX itself. In
total, hundreds of Falcon 9 rockets have been built and launched, many
of which have been successfully reused. Starting with the Demo-2
mission (May 2020), SpaceX is launching astronauts to the
International Space Station aboard Falcon 9 rockets.
