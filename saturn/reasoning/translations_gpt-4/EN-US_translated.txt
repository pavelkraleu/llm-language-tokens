Falcon 9 is an operational American two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift
launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport
of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit. The rocket is
human-rated, has two stages, and is powered with liquid fuel. First
flown in 2010, it has been used for numerous cargo resupply missions
to the International Space Station, as well as launching various
satellites and interplanetary missions. As of 2023, the Falcon 9 has
been used to carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS)
under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Falcon 9 holds records for the
most flights of any orbital rocket: over 125, many of which have been
to low Earth orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 is the first rocket in the
Falcon family of rockets, and was designed under the direction of Elon
Musk at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX is the
sole contractor. A large number of flight-capable vehicles have been
built, with the rocket being designed for reusability to reduce the
cost of access to space. Most launches have been from Cape Canaveral
Space Launch Complex 40 and Kennedy Space Center with no loss of crew
or payload. Falcon 9 has enabled numerous astronauts and cargo
payloads to reach the ISS since its first crewed flight in May 2020.
