Falcon 9 is a US launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for space
missions. It is a human-powered rocket with two stages and is fuelled
by liquid propellant. It has flown several unmanned flights to the
International Space Station since 2010. By 2023, Falcon 9 will have
been a key launcher carrying payloads beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
Falcon 9 has the capacity to carry up to 22 800 kg (50 265 lb) to low
Earth orbit and 8 300 kg (18 300 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit
(GTO). Falcon 9 is the second production model of the Falcon rocket
family and was designed and manufactured by SpaceX in Hawthorne,
California, with SpaceX as prime contractor. To date, dozens of Falcon
9 rockets have been built and launched, many of them more than once,
as the Falcon 9 is designed to be reusable. The Falcon 9 has also been
used to launch Crew Dragon vehicles, which have carried astronauts to
the International Space Station.
