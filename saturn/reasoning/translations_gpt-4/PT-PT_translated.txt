Falcon 9 is a reusable American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for
space exploration. The rocket is human-capable, has two stages and is
fuelled with liquid fuel. It flew for the first time in 2010 and has
since been used for numerous flights, including launching satellites,
fuelling the International Space Station and the Crew Dragon mission,
which took astronauts into space. As of 2023, the Falcon 9 is one of
the launch vehicles that has carried human beings into Low Earth Orbit
(LEO). The Falcon 9 is capable of carrying a payload of up to 22,800kg
into low Earth orbit. The most powerful model in the Falcon rocket
family, the Falcon 9 was designed under the direction of Elon Musk at
SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. A total of more than 100 flight-
capable vehicles were built, many of which were reused thanks to the
rocket's first-stage propulsive landing system. A total of 4
astronauts were launched into space on SpaceX's Crew-1 mission in
November 2020.
