The Falcon 9 is an active mid-range launch vehicle developed by SpaceX
for various missions, including cargo and passenger missions to the
International Space Station (ISS). The rocket has two stages, and is
powered by liquid fuel. Since its first flight in 2010, the rocket has
been used for a variety of missions, including satellite launches,
supply missions to the ISS, and sending humans into orbit.  By 2023,
Falcon 9 has become the launch vehicle that enables increased
accessibility beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the record
for being the first orbital rocket to land again and is capable of
being reused: contributing to SpaceX's efforts to reduce launch costs.
The lead model in SpaceX's rocket family, the Falcon 9 is designed and
manufactured in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX serves as the prime
contractor, controlling the entire production process, from design to
launch. A total of 125+ Falcon 9 rockets have been launched, with a
high success rate. Falcon 9 has sent many astronauts to the ISS
through the Crew Dragon programme.
