Falcon 9 is an operational American medium-sized launch vehicle
developed by SpaceX to transport cargo to the International Space
Station (ISS). The rocket has two stages and liquid propellant and is
designed for human crew. It has been in use since 2010 and has been
used for numerous cargo shipments to the ISS and for the launch of
several satellites.  Since 2023, Falcon 9 has been one of the key
launch vehicles that have carried humans to the International Space
Station (ISS). Falcon 9 is known for its ability to launch payloads
into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and then land back on Earth for reuse: up
to 22,800 kg in LEO, which has enabled a number of missions, including
sending the Crew Dragon spacecraft to the ISS.  Falcon 9, the largest
production model of the Falcon family of rockets, was designed under
Elon Musk's leadership at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX is
the prime contractor. In total, dozens of flight-capable vehicles have
been built. Many have been launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force
Station and Kennedy Space Center without loss of crew or payload.
Since 2020, Falcon 9 has launched numerous astronauts to the
International Space Station.
