Falcon 9 is a two-stage orbital launcher developed by SpaceX in the
United States, designed to transport both goods and people to Earth
orbit and beyond. The rocket uses liquid propellant. It has been used
since 2010 for a variety of missions, including supplying the
International Space Station and launching satellites into orbit.  The
Falcon 9 is an important part of SpaceX's goal to reduce the cost of
space travel through reusable rocket technology. This rocket is the
first to have been able to send a payload into orbit and return to the
ground for reuse. Falcon 9 has the capability to deliver a low Earth
orbit (LEO) payload of up to 22 800 kg.  Falcon 9 was designed and
manufactured at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Until
the end of 2021, several versions of the Falcon 9 rocket have been
built and flown, including the 'Full Thrust' version, which has been
able to return and land after being sent into orbit, and the 'Block 5'
version, currently in service, which SpaceX claims is the ultimate
high-performance version. Falcon 9 is the only rocket to have sent
humans to the International Space Station since the end of the US
Space Shuttle programme in 2011.
