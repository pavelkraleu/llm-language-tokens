Falcon 9 is a US reusable launch vehicle, developed by SpaceX for both
manned and unmanned missions to the International Space Station and
beyond. The rocket is human-rated, two-stage and liquid-fuelled. Since
2010, it has been used for numerous missions, including delivering
payloads to space and sending astronauts to the International Space
Station. Since 2020, the Falcon 9 has flown multiple manned missions
to low-Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the record for being the
first commercially successful reusable rocket, with a payload capacity
to LEO of 22,800 kg (50,265 lb). Falcon 9, the most commonly used
model of SpaceX's rocket family, was designed under the direction of
Elon Musk at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California; the
rocket's components are manufactured at the company's facilities
across the United States. To date, numerous Falcon 9 vehicles have
been built and launched, with an impressive track record of success. A
total of several astronauts have been launched to the International
Space Station aboard the Crew Dragon spacecraft, which is launched
into space atop the Falcon 9.
