Falcon 9 is an active US medium-class launcher developed by SpaceX.
The rocket is designed to carry cargo as well as people, has two
stages and is powered by liquid fuel. Since 2010, it has been used for
a number of missions to deliver cargo to Earth orbit, as well as to
launch various satellites, space stations and manned vehicles.  Falcon
9 is one of the most widely used launchers today, particularly because
of its reentry and landing capability, which allows the first stage to
be used multiple times. Falcon 9 is capable of lifting a payload of up
to 22,800kg into low earth orbit (LEO).  Falcon 9, the most important
model in the SpaceX rocket family, was designed and is manufactured in
Hawthorne, California. The prime contractor is SpaceX. Since its first
launch in 2010, Falcon 9 has carried out more than a hundred missions
with no crew losses, most of which resulted in a successful first
stage landing. Falcon 9 has also carried several manned missions to
the International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew
programme.
