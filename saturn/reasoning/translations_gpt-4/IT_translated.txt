The Falcon 9 is a partially reusable American launch vehicle developed
by SpaceX for resupply missions to the International Space Station
(ISS) and for launching satellites. The rocket is liquid-propelled,
has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel. The first flight took
place in 2010 and continues to be used; among many missions, it has
also launched astronauts to the ISS as part of the Crew Dragon
programme. Since 2023, the Falcon 9 has made numerous flights, several
of which have passed Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 holds the
record as the first liquid-propelled rocket to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere and land vertically. Its payload capacity to low Earth
orbit is 22,800 kg. The Falcon 9 is part of the family of launch
vehicles developed by SpaceX, designed under the direction of Elon
Musk. In total, more than 100 Falcon 9 vehicles have been built and
launched since 2023, with a high success rate and no crew losses.
Thanks to its reusability, the Falcon 9 has significantly reduced the
cost of access to space.
