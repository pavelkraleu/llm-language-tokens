The Falcon 9 is an American high-capacity launch vehicle developed by
SpaceX as part of NASA's Commercial Crew program to transport crews
and cargo into space. The rocket is designed for both humans and
cargo, has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel and liquid oxygen.
Flying since 2010, Falcon 9 has been used for multiple missions,
including transporting crew and cargo to the International Space
Station. As of 2023, Falcon 9 remains the only launch vehicle to have
carried humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the
records for the heaviest payload launched and the largest payload
capacity to low Earth orbit: 50,265 lb (22,800 kg), which included the
Dragon spacecraft for crew and cargo transport. The largest production
model in the Falcon family of rockets, Falcon 9 was designed by SpaceX
under the leadership of Elon Musk at the company's headquarters in
Hawthorne, California; the prime contractor is SpaceX. A total of
several flight-capable Falcon 9 rockets have been built. The majority
of launches were conducted from Space Launch Complex 40 in Cape
Canaveral, Florida, with no loss of crew or payload. In total, Falcon
9 has been used to transport crew and payloads on several space
missions since the start of the Commercial Crew program.
