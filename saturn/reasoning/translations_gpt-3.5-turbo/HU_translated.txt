The Falcon 9 is a retired US super-heavy launch vehicle developed by
SpaceX for human spaceflight and cargo transport. The rocket performs
both manned and automated missions, is two-stage and uses liquid
methane and liquid oxygen as fuel. The spacecraft, which flew in the
2010s, was used for low-Earth orbits with nine crew and to supply
international space stations.  From 2023, Falcon 9 will remain the
only launch vehicle to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The
Falcon 9 holds the record for heaviest payload launched and largest
payload capacity to low Earth orbit: 50,265 pounds (22,800 kg), which
includes one stage and unburned propellant for spacecraft and cargo
carriers.  The Falcon 9, the largest production model in the Falcon
rocket family, was designed under Elon Musk's direction at SpaceX
headquarters in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX is the lead contractor.
A total of 118 flight-capable vehicles have been built, plus many for
ground testing. The first launch took place in 2010 and since then, a
number of successful missions have been carried out, including the
delivery of astronauts and cargo to space stations.
