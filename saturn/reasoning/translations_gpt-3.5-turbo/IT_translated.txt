The Falcon 9 is an American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX for
transporting cargo to Earth orbit and beyond. The rocket is liquid-
propelled, consists of two stages and is fuelled by liquid oxygen and
RP-1, a type of paraffin. First flown in 2010, the Falcon 9 has been
used for numerous missions, including commercial satellite launches,
resupplies for the International Space Station and space probe
launches.  Starting in 2023, the Falcon 9 will be one of the main
launch vehicles for transporting astronauts beyond low Earth orbit.
The Falcon 9's payload capacity varies depending on the destination
orbit, but it can carry up to 22,800 kg in low Earth orbit and up to
8,300 kg in geostationary transfer orbit.  The Falcon 9 was designed
and developed by SpaceX, a company owned by Elon Musk. It is built
primarily at their production facility in Hawthorne, California.
SpaceX has worked in collaboration with various partners and
suppliers, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Numerous Falcon 9s
have been built and launched to date, with a significant record of
success.  The Falcon 9 represents a new generation of space rockets,
with a modern design and advanced technology. Its reliability and
payload capacity make it one of the most widely used rockets in the
space sector today.
