Falcon 9 is a privately-funded US super-heavy-lift launch vehicle
designed for a variety of space missions, including orbiting the Earth
and supplying the International Space Station. The rocket is a human-
class, two-stage rocket using liquid propellant. It has been used
since 2010 on a number of unmanned and manned missions.  As of 2023,
the Falcon 9 remains one of the main launchers to have taken humans
beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds a number of records,
including delivering the largest payload to low Earth orbit: 50,265
pounds (22,800 kg), which included the Dragon capsule and the unburned
propellant needed to supply the International Space Station.  The
Falcon 9 is part of the SpaceX rocket family, designed under the
leadership of Elon Musk and manufactured at SpaceX headquarters in
Hawthorne, California. The prime contractor is SpaceX itself. In
total, a number of flight-capable vehicles have been built and
deployed on several missions. A number of Falcon 9 missions have been
launched from Kennedy Space Center without any loss of crew or
payload. Falcon 9 has carried several satellites and spacecraft into
Earth orbit since 2010.
