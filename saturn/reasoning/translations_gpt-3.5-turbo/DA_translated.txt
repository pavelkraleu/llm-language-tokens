The Falcon 9 is an active American super-heavy launcher developed by
SpaceX to deliver payloads to space. The rocket is certified to carry
humans and consists of two stages fuelled by liquid oxygen and rocket
fuel. The first flight took place in 2010 and it has since been used
for numerous satellite and spacecraft launches. In 2023, Falcon 9 is
still the only launch vehicle to take humans beyond low Earth orbit
(LEO). Falcon 9 holds the record for the heaviest payload launched and
the largest payload capacity for low Earth orbit: 22,800kg, which
includes satellites and other space material. The Falcon 9 is the
largest model in the Falcon family of rockets and was designed under
the direction of SpaceX at their facilities in Hawthorne, California.
SpaceX also serves as the prime contractor for the rocket. Several
flight-ready Falcon 9 rockets have been built for launch. Most
launches have been successful, with only a small number of failures
and payload losses. The Falcon 9 has also been used to launch
spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) and to test the
reusability of rocket stages.
