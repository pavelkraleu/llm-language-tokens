Falcon 9 is a US super-heavy launch vehicle, developed by SpaceX as
part of the space exploration programme. The rocket is human-rated,
two-stage and liquid-fuelled. Since its debut in 2010, the Falcon 9
has been used to launch numerous missions, including carrying payloads
to low Earth orbit (LEO) and the International Space Station. Falcon 9
holds the records for heaviest payload launched and highest payload
capacity to LEO: 22,800 kg (50,300 lb), which includes the payload and
propellant required for launch. Falcon 9, the largest production model
in SpaceX's family of rockets, was designed under the direction of
Elon Musk and his team at SpaceX's Hawthorne, California facility;
prime contractors are SpaceX and its aerospace suppliers. Numerous
Falcon 9s have been built and launched, with a track record of
successfully delivering payloads to their intended destination.
