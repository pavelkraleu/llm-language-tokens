Falcon 9 is a US super-heavy launcher developed by SpaceX to launch
satellites and supply the International Space Station. The rocket is
human-capable, has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel. The
Falcon 9 has been flying since 2010 and has been used for numerous
missions, including launching satellites and performing resupply
flights to the ISS.  As of 2023, the Falcon 9 will no longer be the
only launcher that has taken humans beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO).
However, the Falcon 9 is known for its reusability, making it possible
to significantly reduce the cost of space missions. The Falcon 9 has a
payload capacity of up to 50,265 lb (22,800 kg) to low Earth orbit.
The Falcon 9 was designed and developed by SpaceX under the leadership
of Elon Musk. The company is responsible for both the design and
production of the rocket. Since its first launch, the Falcon 9 has
established an impressive track record, with successful launches and
first-stage landings. This has led to significant cost savings and
revolutionised the space industry.
