The Falcon 9 is a medium-sized American launch vehicle currently in
use, developed by SpaceX as part of its commercial space launch
programmes. The rocket is classified as human-rated, has two stages
and is fuelled with liquid fuel. It flew for the first time in 2010
and is still in operation today, being used for commercial and
government missions. As of 2023, the Falcon 9 is the only launch
vehicle to have carried humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9
holds the records for the heaviest payload launched and the highest
payload capacity to low Earth orbit: 22,800 kg (50,265 lb). This
includes the second stage and unburned propellant needed to send the
Dragon capsule and its contents into the desired orbit. The largest
production model in the Falcon rocket family, Falcon 9 was designed
under the direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX; the main contractors were
SpaceX and its subsidiaries. In total, multiple flight-capable
vehicles were built, as well as prototypes for ground tests. Several
were launched from the Kennedy Space Centre without loss of crew or
payload. A total of astronauts have been launched on commercial and
government missions.
