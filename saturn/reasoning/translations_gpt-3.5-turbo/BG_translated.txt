Falcon 9 is a retired American super-heavy launch vehicle developed by
the SpaceX company to deliver cargo and crew to the International
Space Station (ISS). The rocket is designed for crewed and uncrewed
missions, has two stages and is powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen.
It has been used from 2010 to the present for multiple flights to the
ISS and for commercial satellite missions. As of 2023, Falcon 9
remains the only launch vehicle that has carried humans and cargo to
the ISS. Falcon 9 holds the records for heaviest payload launched and
largest payload capacity to low-Earth orbit: 50,265 lb (22,800 kg),
which includes the second stage and unburned fuel needed to deliver
cargo and crew to the ISS. The largest production model of the Falcon
family of rockets, the Falcon 9, was designed by SpaceX in Hawthorne,
California; the lead contractors were SpaceX engineers and
specialists. A total of 128 vehicles have been built, and many for
ground testing. All rockets launched have been able to reach the
specified orbit without loss of payload. Since 2012, a total of 50
missions have been launched with different targets.
