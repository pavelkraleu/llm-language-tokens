Falcon 9 is a retired American super-heavy-lift launch vehicle
developed by SpaceX. The rocket was human-rated, two-stage and powered
by liquid fuel. Falcon 9 has not been used for manned exploration of
the Moon, but since 2012 it has been performing high payload missions
to low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond. Falcon 9 holds the records for
the heaviest payload launched and the largest payload capacity to low
Earth orbit: 50,265 lb (22,800 kg). Falcon 9 includes the second stage
and unburned propellant needed to send the Dragon spacecraft to LEO.
Falcon 9, the largest production model of the Falcon rocket family,
was designed at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California; SpaceX
was the prime contractor. A total of 135 flight-capable vehicles were
built. One of these vehicles was used to carry the Crew Dragon
spacecraft in 2019. In total, Falcon 9 has successfully launched
dozens of crew and hundreds of payloads.
