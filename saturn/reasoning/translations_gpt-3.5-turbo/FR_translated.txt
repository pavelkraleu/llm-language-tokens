Falcon 9 is an American launcher developed by SpaceX as part of the
space programme for human exploration and the transport of cargo to
low-Earth orbit. The rocket is suitable for transporting people and
cargo, has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel. In use since
2010, it has been used for several crewed flights to the International
Space Station and for the launch of commercial satellites. In 2023,
the Falcon 9 will hold the record for the most successful crewed
flights to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 holds the records for
the heaviest payload launched and the largest payload capacity to LEO:
22,800 kg (50,265 lb), including the second stage and unburned
propellant needed to send satellites and spacecraft to their
destination. The largest production model in the Falcon family of
rockets, the Falcon 9 was designed under the direction of Elon Musk at
SpaceX. The main contractors were SpaceX and its subcontractors. In
all, a large number of flight-ready vehicles were built. Most were
launched from SpaceX's launch pad without loss of crew or payload. In
total, many astronauts and cosmonauts have been sent to the
International Space Station since 2010.
