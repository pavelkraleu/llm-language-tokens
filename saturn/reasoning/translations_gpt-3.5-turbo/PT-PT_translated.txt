The Falcon 9 is a super-heavy, refurbished American launch vehicle
developed by SpaceX as part of the space programme for human and
commercial space exploration. The rocket is capable of carrying
humans, has two stages and is fuelled with liquid fuel. It flew for
the first time in 2010 and has been used on missions to low Earth
orbit and beyond. From 2023, Falcon 9 will be the only launch vehicle
to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the
records for the heaviest payload launched and the highest payload
capacity to low Earth orbit: 50,265 lb (22,800 kg), which included the
third stage and the unburned propellant needed to send the space
capsule and other equipment into space. The largest production model
in the Falcon rocket family, the Falcon 9 was designed under the
direction of Elon Musk at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne,
California; the main contractors were SpaceX, Tesla, Boeing and NASA.
Several flight-capable vehicles have been built, and all have been
successfully launched. A total of astronauts will be launched by
Falcon 9 for space missions.
