The Falcon 9 is an American launch vehicle developed by SpaceX to
promote space exploration and commercial missions. The rocket is
certified for manned missions, consists of two stages and is powered
by liquid fuel. It has been in operation since 2010 and has been used
to launch both satellites and spacecraft. As of 2023, the Falcon 9 is
the only launch vehicle that has transported humans beyond low Earth
orbit (LEO). The Falcon 9 holds the record for the heaviest payload
launched and the largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit: 50,300
lb (22,800 kg), which includes the second stage and the necessary fuel
to send spacecraft to their destinations. The Falcon 9 is one of
several models in SpaceX's rocket range and was designed under the
direction of Elon Musk and his team at SpaceX's facilities in
Hawthorne, California. The rocket has completed a large number of
successful missions and has established itself as a reliable launch
platform for both commercial and scientific purposes. No loss of crew
or payload has been reported during Falcon 9 missions. In total, a
large number of satellites and spacecraft have been launched, and
Falcon 9 has also been used to reuse its first stages to reduce the
cost of spaceflight.
