The Falcon 9 is an active American super heavy-lift launch vehicle
developed by SpaceX to support a variety of missions, including
carrying payloads into orbit and to the International Space Station
(ISS). The rocket is human-rated, has two stages and is fuelled by
liquid propellant. It has been used for numerous missions since 2010,
including the transport of crew to the ISS.  Until 2023, the Falcon 9
is the only launch vehicle to have transported humans to the ISS. The
Falcon 9 holds records for the heaviest payload launched and the
largest payload capacity for low Earth orbit: 22,800 kg (50,265 lb),
including the second stage and unburned propellant.  The Falcon 9, the
flagship of SpaceX's rocket family, was developed under the direction
of Elon Musk and is produced by SpaceX at various facilities,
including the SpaceX Launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket
has a high level of reusability, as both the first stage and the
spacecraft capsule can return to Earth and be reused.  In total,
several dozen airworthy vehicles have been built and launched without
losing crew or payload. The Falcon 9 has successfully completed
missions for customers such as NASA, satellite operators and space
agencies around the world.
