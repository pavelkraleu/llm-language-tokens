Falcon 9 is an American heavy vehicle launch vehicle developed by
SpaceX. The rocket is human-powered, has two stages and is powered by
liquid fuel. It has flown since 2010 and is used for launching
satellites and payloads into low Earth orbit. As of 2023, Falcon 9
will remain the only launch vehicle that has carried humans beyond low
Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the record for the heaviest payload
launched and the largest payload capacity in low Earth orbit: 50,265
lb (22,800 kg), which includes the second stage and the unburned
propellant needed to send the payload payload into orbit around Earth.
The largest production model of the Falcon rocket family, the Falcon 9
was designed by SpaceX. Many Falcon 9s are being built for flight,
with many contractors including SpaceX, Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
Many successful Falcon 9 launches have already taken place, and in
total many satellites and payloads have been launched into orbit
around the Earth.
