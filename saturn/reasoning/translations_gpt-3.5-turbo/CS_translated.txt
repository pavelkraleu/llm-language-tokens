Falcon 9 is an active American super heavy lift rocket developed by
SpaceX to carry cargo into space. The rocket is designed for cargo,
has two stages and is powered by liquid oxygen and liquid kerosene. It
has been flying since 2010 and has been used for many successful
missions, including carrying the ISS space station and satellites into
space.  As of 2023, Falcon 9 remains one of the launch vehicles that
have carried payloads beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Falcon 9 holds the
records for heaviest payload launched and largest payload to low Earth
orbit: 50,265 lb (22,800 kg), which includes the second stage and its
fuel.  Falcon 9, the largest production model in the Falcon family of
rockets, was designed and developed by SpaceX. SpaceX is the prime
contractor. A total of 136 airworthy vehicles have been built to date.
All have been successfully launched without loss of cargo. The Falcon
9 is one of the most reliable rockets in the world and is still being
refined to perform even more challenging missions in the future.
