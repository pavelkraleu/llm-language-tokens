Falcon 9 is the current super heavy-lift launch vehicle developed by
SpaceX for human space exploration and sending payloads to low Earth
orbit. The rocket has two stages and is powered by liquid fuel. Flown
since 2010, the Falcon 9 has been used for many missions, including
sending crews to the International Space Station.  To date, the Falcon
9 has carried humans into low Earth orbit (LEO) on several manned
missions. Falcon 9 also holds the record for the heaviest payload
launched into low Earth orbit: 50,300 lb (22,800 kg), including the
second stage and unburned propellant.  The Falcon 9 was designed and
developed by SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX is the prime
contractor for this rocket. So far, the Falcon 9 has launched more
than 100 missions, including sending communications satellites,
spacecraft and other payloads into orbit.  The Falcon 9 is one of the
most reliable and innovative rockets available today. SpaceX continues
to make developments and improvements to the Falcon 9 to increase its
efficiency and reliability in space missions.
