Falcon 9 is an active American super-heavy launcher developed by
SpaceX under the Commercial Crew programme for human space
exploration. The rocket is unmanned, has two stages and is fuelled by
liquid fuel. It has been in use since 2010 and has been involved in
many missions, including carrying manned craft to the International
Space Station (ISS). As of 2023, Falcon 9 is the only launcher still
in operation that has carried humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO).
Falcon 9 holds the record for the largest payload launched and the
largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit: 22,800kg, which includes
the mission payload and the unburned propellant required for the
mission. Falcon 9 is the largest production model in the Falcon rocket
series and was constructed under the direction of SpaceX engineers at
the company's facility in Hawthorne, California. The main contractor
is SpaceX itself. In total, dozens of flightworthy vehicles have been
built and launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex and
Kennedy Space Centre without loss of crew or payload. The Falcon 9 has
been used to carry astronauts and supplies to the ISS, as well as to
place satellites in Earth orbit.
